# Smart-stick-for-blind-people-using-arduino-uno-and-two-ultrasonic-sensor
This is a stick that can alert blind people about front side obstacle and manhole . 

One step to help blind pedestrian:
----------------------------------
This code runs teo ultrasonic sensor . 
One utrasonic sensor measure the distance between the stick and frontside obstacle 
Other ultrasonic sensor measure distance from surface
If there is any manhole or an obstacle in front than reamining buzzer which is connected with arduino uno started to alarm that alert the blind pedestrian
